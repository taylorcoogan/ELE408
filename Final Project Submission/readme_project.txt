This project is a simon says game written for Altera DE1-SOC FPGAs to play against eachother over a network.  
This game can also be played on "normal" PCs with some minor alterations to the code
-- Commenting out the python script references to the C programs that use FPGA exclusive components
-- Commenting IN the python script references to the sound files will allow you to play the game with sound assuming your sound drivers and all that are set up properly.
This project was for my URI ELE 408 class as the final project.
